  All artifacts with the same ENVIRONMENT_KEY are grouped in an instance of this
  class.

  Artifacts may also have a value specified for the INVOCATION_KEY to denote how
  to run the artifact. This value may in turn use PLACEHOLDER_ARGS to denote
  where to insert the command-line arguments.

  If an artifact does not have an INVOCATION_KEY defined, but has a BINARY_KEY
  defined, the binary is executed with the value of PATH_KEY as its first
  argument, followed by the sample arguments. (Note that this usage is
  deprecated.)

  If neither INVOCATION_KEY nor BINARY_KEY are specified but PATH_KEY is
  specified, then path is executed with the artifact arguments.

  If none of INVOCATION_KEY, BINARY_KEY, nor PATH_KEY are specified, calls
  result in errors.

  The default invocation key can be overriden by passing a key-value pair
  (INVOCATION_KEY:  "new_invocation_key") in the manifest_options argument to init.

  Similarly, the default chdir key can be overriden by passing a key-value pair
  (CHDIR_KEY:  "new_chdir_key") in the manifest_options argument to init.
