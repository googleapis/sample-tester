# The most typical use pattern is the following:
test:
  suites:
  - name:  "Language samples test"
    setup:     # can have yaml and/or code, just as in the cases below
      - code:
          log('In setup')
    teardown:  # can have yaml and/or code, just as in the cases below
      - code:
          log('In teardown')          
    cases:
      
    - name: "A test defined via yaml directives"
      spec:
      - call:
          target: "language_analyze_sentiment_text"
          params:
            content:
              literal: "happy happy smile hope"
      - assert_success: [] # try assert_failure to see how failure looks
      - assert_contains:
          - message: "Score is very positive"
          - literal: "score: 0.8"
      - assert_contains:
          - message: "Magnitude is very positive"
          - literal: "magnitude: 0.8"
      - assert_not_contains:
          - message: "Random message"
          - literal: "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain"
# Above is the typical usage
