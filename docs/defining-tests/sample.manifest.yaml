# A manifest file can contain any number of manifest documents, each
# preceded by the YAML `---` document separator.

# In this second YAML document, we make use of YAML anchors (`&`) and
# references (`*`) as well as the manifest file inclusion semantics
# (`{}`) to illustrate how fields common to multiple elements of the
# list may be factored out to reduce code duplication and increase
# understandability.
