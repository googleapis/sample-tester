version: 1  # determines how to parse the rest of the file
sets:       # a list of groupings
# Each grouping can list any number of grouping-wide labels name/value
# pairs. These name/value pairs are applied to every item; if the item
# already has a label with that name, the value specified here is
# prepended to the value specified in the item. The idea is that you
# can specify repeated parts of a path up here, and only the parts
# that vary in each item
